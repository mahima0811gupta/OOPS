✅ Platform Dependent vs Platform Independent (Short Notes)
🔹 C – Platform Dependent

Because C compiles code into machine code specific to the operating system.

🔹 C++ – Platform Dependent

Same as C.
C++ also generates OS-specific machine code, so it cannot run on another platform.

🔹 Java – Platform Independent

Because Java code is compiled into bytecode, and this bytecode runs on the JVM, which is available on all platforms.

🔹 Python – Platform Independent

Because Python code is converted into bytecode (.pyc), and it runs on the Python interpreter available on all platforms.


17. What is namespace?

A namespace is a container that groups names (like classes, functions, variables) to avoid name conflicts in large programs.
Example: std is a namespace in C++.

✅ 18. What is this pointer?

this is a special pointer inside a class that stores the address of the current object.
Used to access the current object's variables and methods.

✅ 19. What is reference variable?

A reference variable is another name/alias for an existing variable.
It does not store its own value; it refers to the original variable.

Example:

int a = 10;
int &ref = a;   // ref is a reference to a

✅ 20. Difference between C and C++? (Short Answer)
| C                                     | C++                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Procedural programming language       | Object-oriented + procedural           |
| No classes, objects                   | Supports classes, objects, OOP         |
| Does not support function overloading | Supports function/function overloading |
| No namespace                          | Has namespace                          |
| Less secure                           | More secure due to encapsulation       |
