C++ does not have a direct interface keyword like Java.
But you can create an interface using a class that contains only pure virtual functions.

✔ No normal functions
✔ No data members
✔ Only pure virtual functions (= 0)
✔ You cannot create objects of an interface
✔ Any class that inherits must override all functions

Such a class acts exactly like an interface.

✅ Simple C++ Interface Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Interface in C++ → class with ONLY pure virtual functions
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;     
    virtual void area() = 0;     
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() {
        cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl;
    }
    void area() {
        cout << "Area = πr²" << endl;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() {
        cout << "Drawing Rectangle" << endl;
    }
    void area() {
        cout << "Area = length × breadth" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* s;

    Circle c;
    Rectangle r;

    s = &c;
    s->draw();
    s->area();

    s = &r;
    s->draw();
    s->area();
}

📌 Output
Drawing Circle
Area = πr²
Drawing Rectangle
Area = length × breadth

🔑 Key Points (Easy English)

An interface in C++ is created by using a class with only pure virtual functions.
You cannot create objects of an interface.
A derived class must implement all the pure virtual functions, otherwise it also becomes abstract.
Interface is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.




Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface (C++)

| Feature                             | Abstract Class                                                                   | Interface (in C++)                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**                      | A class that can have both normal functions and pure virtual functions           | A class that contains **only pure virtual functions**                         |
| **Object Creation**                 | Cannot create objects                                                            | Cannot create objects                                                         |
| **Functions Allowed**               | Normal functions + pure virtual functions                                        | Only pure virtual functions                                                   |
| **Data Members**                    | Can have data members                                                            | Cannot have data members                                                      |
| **Constructor / Destructor**        | Yes, can have constructors and destructors                                       | No constructors or destructors                                                |
| **Multiple Inheritance**            | A class can inherit only one abstract class (if using normal single inheritance) | A class can inherit multiple interfaces                                       |
| **Use Case**                        | When you want to provide **common code + a blueprint**                           | When you want to provide only **a complete blueprint** (no implementation)    |
| **Implementation in Derived Class** | Must implement only the pure virtual functions                                   | Must implement **all functions** because all are pure virtual                 |
| **Keyword**                         | No special keyword; just one pure virtual function                               | No special keyword; interface is created by making all functions pure virtual |


A class can inherit multiple interfaces in C++.
