this pointer holds the address of the current object. In simple words, you can say that this pointer points to the current object of the class. 
There can be three main usages of this keyword in C++.
It can be used to refer to a current class instance variable.
It can be used to pass the current object as a parameter to another method.
It can be used to declare indexers.



#include <iostream>
class Hero {
public:
    int health;
    Hero(int health) {
        // std::cout << "Address of current object: " << this << std::endl;
        this->health = health; // 'this->health' refers to the object's health, 'health' refers to the parameter
    }
};

int main() {
    Hero ramesh(100);
    // std::cout << "Address of ramesh: " << &ramesh << std::endl;
    // You'd see that 'this' inside the constructor for 'ramesh' holds the same address as &ramesh.
    return 0;
}
