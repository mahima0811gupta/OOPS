✅ Platform Dependent vs Platform Independent (Short Notes)
🔹 C – Platform Dependent

Because C compiles code into machine code specific to the operating system.

🔹 C++ – Platform Dependent

Same as C.
C++ also generates OS-specific machine code, so it cannot run on another platform.

🔹 Java – Platform Independent

Because Java code is compiled into bytecode, and this bytecode runs on the JVM, which is available on all platforms.

🔹 Python – Platform Independent

Because Python code is converted into bytecode (.pyc), and it runs on the Python interpreter available on all platforms.
