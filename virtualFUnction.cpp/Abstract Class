An abstract class is a class from which you cannot create an object directly.
It serves as a base class that defines a common structure or interface for its derived classes.
An abstract class must have at least one pure virtual function.

Key Properties
✅ It can include both normal functions and variables, along with pure virtual functions.
🚫 You can’t make an object of an abstract class.
🧠 It’s mainly used for upcasting — treating a derived class object as a base class reference or pointer.
⚙️ If a derived class doesn’t define all pure virtual functions, it also becomes abstract.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    // Pure Virtual Function → makes Base an abstract class
    virtual void show() = 0;  
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Virtual Function implemented in Derived class";
    }
};

int main() {
    // Base b; ❌ Not allowed — cannot create an object of abstract class
    Base *ptr;        // Pointer to Base class
    Derived d;  // Object of Derived class
    ptr = &d;     // Upcasting (Derived → Base pointer)
    ptr->show();      // Calls Derived's implementation
}

Output Virtual Function implemented in Derived class


If Derived Doesn’t Override

If Derived does not provide its own version of show(), then it also becomes an abstract class — and you still can’t create an object of it.

🔹 Why Abstract Classes Are Useful
They help achieve runtime polymorphism.
They define a blueprint or interface for all derived classes.
They ensure consistency among related classes in a program.
