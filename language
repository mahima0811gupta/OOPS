✅ Platform Dependent vs Platform Independent (Short Notes)
🔹 C – Platform Dependent

Because C compiles code into machine code specific to the operating system.

🔹 C++ – Platform Dependent

Same as C.
C++ also generates OS-specific machine code, so it cannot run on another platform.

🔹 Java – Platform Independent

Because Java code is compiled into bytecode, and this bytecode runs on the JVM, which is available on all platforms.

🔹 Python – Platform Independent

Because Python code is converted into bytecode (.pyc), and it runs on the Python interpreter available on all platforms.


17. What is namespace?

A namespace is a container that that holds a group of names -  like variables, functions, or classes - to avoid confusion when we have the same name used in different parts of the program.

✅ 18. What is this pointer?
"A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It is used for efficient memory access, dynamic memory allocation, and creating data structures like linked lists."
Call by Value:
Copy of value is sent
Original value does not change

Call by Reference (using pointers):
Address is sent
Original value changes

✅ 19. What is reference variable?

A reference variable is another name/alias for an existing variable.
It does not store its own value; it refers to the original variable.

Example:

int a = 10;
int &ref = a;   // ref is a reference to a

✅ 20. Difference between C and C++? (Short Answer)
| C                                     | C++                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Procedural programming language       | Object-oriented + procedural           |
| No classes, objects                   | Supports classes, objects, OOP         |
| Does not support function overloading | Supports function/function overloading |
| No namespace                          | Has namespace                          |
| Less secure                           | More secure due to encapsulation       |




python 

✅ 1. What is Python?

Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn, general-purpose programming language.

✅ 2. Why is Python called interpreted language?

Because Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, not compiled into machine code directly.

✅ 3. What are variables?

Variables are names used to store values in memory.

✅ 4. What is indentation in Python?

Indentation means spaces at the beginning of a line; it defines code blocks (loops, functions, etc.).

✅ 5. What are data types in Python?

Basic data types: int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict, set.

✅ 6. What is list?

A list is a mutable, ordered collection of items.
Example: [1, 2, 3]

✅ 7. What is tuple?

A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of items.
Example: (1, 2, 3)

✅ 8. Difference between list and tuple?

List → mutable (can change)

Tuple → immutable (cannot change)

✅ 9. What is dictionary?

A dictionary is a key–value data structure.
Example: {"name": "Mahima", "age": 21}

✅ 10. What is set?

A set is an unordered collection of unique items.
Example: {1, 2, 3}

✅ 11. What is function in Python?

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and is reused when called.

✅ 12. What is lambda function?

A lambda is a small anonymous function defined using one line.
Example: lambda x: x * 2

✅ 13. What is module?

A module is a Python file containing functions, classes, or variables.

✅ 14. What is package?

A package is a collection of modules stored in a folder with an __init__.py file.

✅ 15. What is OOP in Python?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming approach based on objects and classes.

✅ 16. What is class?

A class is a blueprint used to create objects.

✅ 17. What is object?

An object is an instance of a class that has data and behavior.

✅ 18. What is constructor (__init__)?

__init__ is a special method that automatically runs when an object is created to initialize variables.

✅ 19. What is inheritance?

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and methods of another class.

✅ 20. What is exception handling?

Exception handling manages runtime errors using try, except, finally so the program doesn't crash.
